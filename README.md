Detecting BtLowEnergy Devices and connecting to it using Android Devices(any version)
This will scan the list of available bluetooth low energy devices.
User can connect the devices through this app.
The application will itself extract the information like mac address and name of bluetooth device.
There is a perticuler sequence of String in the code.
The app will receive the sent data through the ble device and compare will stored String and in accordance to that a report file will be generated in the sd card storage.
Users can also email the generated file through the application.
The main purpose is to connect to ble device and receive data into the device for further application.
Hope it helps.
